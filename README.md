# Simple-OS-C-
This project was done individually. We were asked to build a simple window interface that allows the user to navigate between directories, execute files, display text files and respond with appropriate message if permission is not allowed to do a specific action.
The structure of the program was written in C and the interface was using some special language, called IOL, used within Monash University.
